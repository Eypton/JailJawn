Data Source (http://www.phila.gov/prisons/page.htm)

##What is Jail Jawn and Why?
Jail Jawn is a project for me to get better a programming in general and I guess do some civic good.
The Philadelphia Prisons System updates a daily census (Human Generated not automated) of the count of all inmates at each facility and there status or location within the prison system. 

Whoever is publishing  the data is using Microsoft Excel Publish as a Webpage Wizard (AWFUL AWFUL HTML OUTPUT). I tried my best to parse the data to dictionaries so I can export to CSV or JSON but with my current skill level and the state of that HTML OUTPUT that isn't happening.

I am going to covert the data I want to strings and build my own system of getting the text into CSV or JSON.
